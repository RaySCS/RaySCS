### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=RaySCS.RaySCS)

I'm proud to be one of the **youngest graduates in program history** from the University of Illinois Chicago, as I just completed my B.S. degree in Computer Science at 19 years old in May, 2023.üéì 

Throughout my career, I mainly have worked in web development and mobile application development. 

<b> Most Recently</b>: I became a best-selling authorüìñ on Amazon through a realistic-fiction novel I published in January, 2021 about a student's journey throughout the world of high school and onto the path of technological innovation.
